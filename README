Place the .emacs file in the top level or your home directory and edit the
first line in this file to point to the directory that this file is in.

     (setq load-path (append (list "~cookgb/public/emacs") load-path))
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For faster loading of the four files:
             my-font-lock.el
             keymap.el
             comment.el
             modes.el
you can "byte-compile" them.  This is easily done by typing the following
command in the emacs editor:

	[esc]x byte-compile-file [return]

Emacs will then ask the name of the file to compile.  Enter one of the
file names and press return.  Repeat the proceedure for each of the 
four files.  {Note: [esc]x means press the escape key and keep it depressed
while pressing the x key.}
